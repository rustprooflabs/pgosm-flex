# Routing Roads

PgOSM Flex makes it easy to get started with routing with OpenStreetMap data
and pgRouting. The best experience is with pgRouting 4.0 and newer.
If you are using a pgRouting prior to 4.0 see
[Routing Roads: Legacy (pgRouting 3)](./routing-3.md).


## Prepare routing edge networks

You should have ran the steps in [Prepare for Routing](routing.md#prepare-for-routing)
before continuing.

----


PgOSM Flex includes functions to prepare routing edge networks for data in
`osm.road_line` by running the appropriate procedure.
This procedure can take a while to run on larger regions, see the Timing section
below for more details.

```sql
CALL osm.routing_prepare_road_network();
```

You should see output similar to below. This example is to prepare the data for
Colorado and took 8 minutes in this example. This step takes roughly 20 seconds
to process for Washington D.C.


```
NOTICE:  Edge table table created
NOTICE:  Nearby table created
NOTICE:  Intersection table created
NOTICE:  Blades created
NOTICE:  Split edges created
NOTICE:  Edge data in route_edges_output temp table.
NOTICE:  Created table osm.routing_road_edge
NOTICE:  Created table osm.routing_road_vertex from edges.
NOTICE:  Edge table updated with vertex source/target details.
CALL
Time: 484294.179 ms (08:04.294)
```

The procedure creates two tables:

* `osm.routing_road_edge` 
* `osm.routing_road_vertex`

These tables make up the routing network, built from data in `osm.road_line`.
The `_vertex` table has the points that can be used as start/end points for routes.
The `_edge` table has the edges (lines) that can be routed, along with their
costs and other access control measures.


> Do not make customizations to the tables generated by the procedures without
> renaming the tables to avoid data loss.
>
> Changes to OpenStreetMap data will not be reflected in the routing network
> until the procedure is ran again. This is not automated along with `--replication`.


# Routing Examples

The data preparation procedures above handle the steps to create a routable edge
network with usable costs.


## Determine route start and end

The following query identifies the vertex IDs from the `osm.routing_road_vertex`
table to use for start and end points. 

The query uses an input set of points
created from specific longitude/latitude values.
Make note of the `start_id` and `end_id` values from this query
to use in subsequent queries. The following queries are setup to run
within DBeaver using `:start_id` and `:end_id` variables for dynamic querying.

> The query with Longitude/Latitude simulates a user clicking in a GUI map to set
> start and end points.  This type of interaction typically results in
> longitude and latitude values.


```sql
WITH s_point AS (
SELECT v.id AS start_id, v.geom
    FROM osm.routing_road_vertex v
    INNER JOIN (SELECT
        ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-77.0211, 38.92255), 4326), 3857)
            AS geom
        ) p ON v.geom <-> p.geom < 20
    ORDER BY v.geom <-> p.geom
    LIMIT 1
), e_point AS (
SELECT v.id AS end_id, v.geom
    FROM osm.routing_road_vertex v
    INNER JOIN (SELECT
        ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-77.0183, 38.9227), 4326), 3857)
            AS geom
        ) p ON v.geom <-> p.geom < 20
    ORDER BY v.geom <-> p.geom
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT s_point.start_id, e_point.end_id
        , s_point.geom AS geom_start
        , e_point.geom AS geom_end
    FROM s_point, e_point
;
```

```bash
┌──────────┬────────┐
│ start_id │ end_id │
╞══════════╪════════╡
│    14630 │  14686 │
└──────────┴────────┘
```


> Warning: The vertex IDs returned by the above query will vary. The pgRouting functions that generate this data do not guarantee data will always be generated in precisely the same order, causing these IDs to be different.


## Route with Vertex Start/End IDs

Routing using PgOSM Flex's built-in travel-time calculations is as simple
as running a function, passing in an ID for the start and end vertices.

```sql
SELECT *
    FROM osm.route_motor_travel_time(:vertex_start_id, :vertex_end_id)
;
```


![Screenshot from DBeaver showing the route generated with all roads and limiting based on route_motor and using the improved cost model including forward and reverse costs. The route bypasses the road(s) marked access=no and access=private, as well as respects the one-way access controls.](dc-example-route-start-motor-access-control-oneway.png)


Beyond the route shown in the screenshot above the table below shows the route has
13 total segments and will take an estimated 73 seconds (1 minute, 13 seconds)
to travel.


```
┌──────────┬────────────────────┐
│ segments │ total_cost_seconds │
╞══════════╪════════════════════╡
│       13 │  73.00033290095476 │
└──────────┴────────────────────┘
```

This routing function uses the `cost_motor_forward_s`
and `cost_motor_reverse_s` columns, combined with
the `pgosm.road.traffic_penalty_normal` column, to compute travel time.

> The `pgosm.road.traffic_penalty_normal` column can be adjusted to influence the
> timing model. Other penalty / cost models can also be investigated.

# Routing Data Preparation Timing


This section outlines a few timing references for routing preparation
to help gauge how long this might take for your region's data.
Note these are generic timings using the built-in
database in the PgOSM Flex Docker image, without any tuning from default
configuration. Your tuning and your hardware will influence these timings.

> Note: Testing was done with PgOSM Flex 1.2.1 on a personal laptop.

* D.C.: 18 seconds
* Colorado: 11.5 minutes

The Colorado data set has  1.2M input roads resulting in 2.6M edges after splitting.
